Life Insurance Protection for the people you love. ENROLL ANYTIME Whether you’re just starting out or getting ready for retirement, life insurance can help protect your family’s future. Once you're eligible for benefits, you can enroll or drop this coverage at any time. Peace of mind for you and yours. Company-paid insurance Full-time associates get automatic coverage equal to your annual pay, up to $50,000. Upgrade options Choose up to $200,000 for hourly
associates, or $1 million for
salaried associates and drivers. Family coverage Cover your spouse/partner
and your children up to age 26. How much do you need? Find out in seconds with this life insurance calculator Life insurance calculator Why life insurance? Think about what would happen if you were gone. You might be leaving funeral expenses, unpaid bills, or even debts. If you have a family, they’d need help with living expenses, education costs, and more. Life insurance lets you breathe easy knowing that everyone who depends on your income will be provided for. Company-paid coverage All full-time hourly associates and salaried associates automatically receive company-paid life insurance. For full-time hourly associates, you’re automatically covered starting on the first day of the calendar month during which your 89th day of continuous full-time employment falls. For salaried associates, you’re automatically covered from your date of hire. If you change to part-time, your coverage will end on the last day of your last full-time pay period. Your benefit amount is equal to your pay, including overtime and bonuses, during the 26 pay periods of active status immediately before your death. This number is rounded to the nearest $1,000, up to a maximum of $50,000. If you’re terminally ill, you can choose to receive up to 50% of the amount your beneficiaries would have received after your death, while you’re still living. For more information, contact Prudential at 877-740-2116 or visit www.prudential.com/walmart. You’ll also find plan details in the Associate Benefits Book. Optional coverage You can also purchase optional coverage. For full-time associates, this is in addition to the amount of your company-paid insurance: Use Prudential’s life insurance needs calculator to help you estimate how much coverage is right for you. Visit Prudential needs calculator. For more information, contact Prudential at 877-740-2116 or visit www.prudential.com/walmart. You’ll also find plan details in the Associate Benefits Book. Life insurance rates Your cost per paycheck depends on your age and tobacco status. When can I enroll? You can enroll for optional life insurance at any time after your initial enrollment period for benefits begins. This is when you first become eligible, and depends on your job classification. When it’s time, check your enrollment options and enroll. If you enroll or upgrade your coverage after you first become eligible, you'll have to provide proof of good health. Naming a beneficiary To make sure your life insurance benefit is paid according to your wishes, you must name one or more beneficiaries. A beneficiary is a person you choose to receive your money when you die. You can name anyone you want. If no beneficiary is named, payment will be made to your surviving family members. You can choose beneficiaries online. Proof of good health You’ll need to complete a questionnaire or have an exam to show proof of good health if: Proof of good health is not required for child life insurance. Download the proof of good health application form: English | Spanish Early payment for terminal illness If you’re terminally ill, you can receive up to 50% of the amount your beneficiary(ies) will receive after your death, while you’re still living. Payment will be made in one lump sum. When you die, your beneficiary(ies) will receive the remaining 50%. This benefit is called the "accelerated benefit" and can help many families during difficult financial times. Changing your address For most associates, you can update your address information in the enrollment tool. Leaving the company? Walmart and Prudential provide two options to continue your life insurance when you leave the company. The portability option allows you to continue all or part of your current coverage through a group term policy with Prudential. The conversion option allows you to convert all or part of your coverage to a Prudential individual policy. Either way, you may be able to continue your coverage. Filing a claim Your beneficiaries must contact Prudential at 877-740-2116 within 90 days of your death, and provide the following information: In addition, they must mail an original or certified copy of the death certificate to:

Becoming eligible: part-time and temporary associates Getting your Walmart benefits When do benefits start? ASAP You can use some benefits as soon as you’re hired. Your effective date
Most plans you enroll for
have an “effective date”
based on your date of hire when your coverage begins. Truck drivers
Truck driver associates have different enrollment and effective dates from part-time and temporary associates. Medical coverage
If you’re a part-time hourly or temporary associate, including field Supply Chain associates and pharmacists but NOT part-time truck drivers, your work hours will be measured every 60 days during your first year of employment. We’ll let you know if you become eligible. For example, let’s say your hire date is May 11, 2022. Your 60th day is July 9, and on that day you’ve worked enough hours to meet the requirement. Your 89th day is Aug. 7, so benefits become effective on Aug. 1. After your first year, your hours will be measured again every year in time for Annual Enrollment in October. This will “look back” over a 52-week measurement period. Track your hours
You can check your hours for the current measurement period anytime with the Eligibility by Hours (EBH) Tool. You’ll need to log in to use the tool. One time only
If you don’t enroll when you first become eligible, you won’t have another opportunity to enroll until the next Annual Enrollment, or if you have a qualifying status event like having a baby. Non-medical benefits
Even if you don’t meet the hours requirement for medical coverage, you’ll still become eligible for many other benefits on your 52-week anniversary date. You can enroll anytime between that date and the first day of the second calendar month following it. For example, let’s say your anniversary date is June 21, 2022. You’ll become eligible on Aug. 1, the first day of the second month after that. Tobacco

Preauthorization Getting preapproval for some services Preauthorization (also called precertification) means you need approval for certain services before you get care, or the plan won’t cover the cost. It’s most often required for hospital inpatient admissions and outpatient surgery. Your plan may also set certain conditions, medical settings, or other limits to coverage. How does it work? If you need preauthorization from a network doctor or hospital, your doctor will usually handle it for you; however, you should double-check by calling your medical plan administrator (the numbers are shown below).Here are some common services that usually need preauthorization: When should you call? If your doctor doesn’t help with preauthorization, or if you’re considering care outside your plan’s network, you’ll need to call for preauthorization yourself.You’ll find the number for your administrator on the back of your plan ID card.

High-quality care for complex conditions If you’re facing something big, like surgery, cancer, or fertility care, you want the very best treatment.

Top-quality care when you need it most 100% covered Treatment and travel are covered for most eligible conditions. The best care Expert care can help you get the right treatment, avoid unnecessary surgery, and get back to your life and work sooner. New options for growing your familyNew in 2023: enhanced coverage for fertility treatment—plus eligible associates have access to covered surrogacy benefits even if you’re not enrolled in a Walmart medical plan. Brian got the spring back in his step. See how hip replacement surgery through Centers of Excellence changed Brian's life. Edna got her happily ever after. Watch this inspiring story and learn how Centers of Excellence can help take care of your heart. Where are the Centers of Excellence? Walmart has partnered with some of the best health centers across the country to make sure you get the best possible care: What’s covered? Program Details If your condition qualifies, your plan pays 100% of eligible costs for most conditions and even covers travel and lodging for you and a companion when utilizing the COE program. You must be enrolled in the Premier, Contribution, Saver plans or a Local plan to be eligible for these benefits. Here are some other important rules and details:Waiting period—Transplants and weight loss surgery have a 12-month waiting period from the date your medical coverage becomes effective before benefits are available.Coverage for COE programs—Coverage for fertility treatments, spine surgeries, transplants and weight loss surgeries is only available under the COE program; in certain circumstances a network exception may apply for spine surgery and transplants. Hip and knee replacements not performed at a COE program will have a reduced benefit, unless a network exception applies. For more information about network exceptions and coverage levels, please see the Associate Benefits Book.Weight loss—Weight loss surgeries performed at a COE facility are covered at the regular benefit level of 75% of eligible in-network costs after you meet your annual deductible.Fertility benefit—Fertility treatments and services, including IVF and IUI, are covered subject to a $20,000 lifetime maximum benefit per person for associates and covered dependents enrolled in the Premier, Saver or Contribution plans or a Local Plan. Coverage may also include travel benefits. Eligible associates also have access to benefits for surrogacy and adoption.Cardiac valve surgery—If you are being considered for heart valve surgery, you and/or your doctor will be directed to set up a cardiac valve “eReview” with Cleveland Clinic to make sure the treatment is appropriate. If they recommend surgery, you’ll be invited to have it done at Cleveland Clinic, where you’ll get 100% coverage instead of 75% of eligible in-network costs at a non-COE (in-network) facility.Saver Plan—If you’re enrolled in the Saver Plan, you must meet your annual network deductible before the Associates' Medical Plan (AMP) pays any benefit to become eligible for the coverage levels shown here. How can you get into these programs? If you think the Centers of Excellence could help you, call your health care advisor. You’ll find the number on the back of your plan ID card.

Specialty medications: Only available through Walmart Specialty Pharmacy. Walmart or Sam’s Club only If you’re in the Premier, Contribution, Saver, or a Local Plan, you must use a Walmart or Sam's Club pharmacy to get your pharmacy benefit. All other pharmacies are considered out-of-network, and in most cases, you'll pay the full retail price.Keep in mind that maintenance medications, like those used to treat high blood pressure and diabetes, need to be filled at a Walmart or Sam’s Club pharmacy, or through Walmart Home Delivery. Specialty medications are only available through Walmart Specialty Pharmacy. What plans are included? What drugs are covered? To be eligible, drugs must be on Walmart's formulary list. This list is maintained by OptumRx. It’s reviewed quarterly and often changes. You can also call OptumRx at 844-705-7493 to ask about a particular drug. For the PPO Plan, you'll find the formulary on Aetna's website.Some brand-name and other prescription drugs aren’t covered because generic, or over-the-counter alternatives have proven to be just as effective. For more information about what is and is not covered, see the “Pharmacy Benefit” section of the Associate Benefits Book. Mail order When you pick up a prescription at a Walmart or Sam’s Club pharmacy, each copay covers up to a 30-day supply. If you take a medication regularly and order it by mail, you’ll pay three times this cost and receive a 90-day supply. Specialty drugs All specialty drugs under the Premier, Contribution, Saver, and Local Plans must be purchased through Walmart Specialty Pharmacy. If a specialty drug is purchased from another network pharmacy, it will not be covered under the plan. You should call a Walmart Specialty Pharmacy to ask about the availability of your prescription drugs under the plan. Medicare coverage If you’ll be eligible for Medicare soon, you should know that Walmart's prescription drug benefit has been determined to be “creditable coverage” as defined by Medicare. That means that on average it's expected to pay as much as, or more than, a standard Medicare drug plan.If you later decide to join a Medicare drug plan, having “creditable coverage” under the Walmart plan will keep you from paying a higher premium under Medicare.

PPO Plan Low costs and 90% coverage for U.S.-Based Global Tech associates working in select areas. Please note: The descriptions of eligibility terms and waiting periods in the policies and enrollment materials for the PPO Plan may be different from those in the Associate Benefits Book. If there’s any difference in how eligibility terms are described, the Associate Benefits Book will control. Great coverage that’s easy to pay for. Low copays Pay just $15 for primary care visits and $25 for specialists. Low deductibles You pay only $300or $600 until the plan kicksin to cover up to 90% of youreligible expenses. Complete coverage Coverage that’s comparable to our national plans, plus acupuncture, chiropractic, vision care, transgender benefits, and more. Preventive care You get 100% coverage for preventive care when you see doctors in your network. This includes things like annual checkups, vaccinations, and mammograms. Simple copays Copays make it easy to plan for medical costs, and you don’t need to meet your deductible first. Other care You’ll pay the full cost for any additional care you receive until you meet your deductible: $300 or $600 depending on who you cover. After that, the plan pays 90% of all in-network eligible medical expenses and 75% of eligible out-of-network medical expenses. Affordable prescriptions Annual deductible Your annual network deductible is just $300 for yourself, or $600 for yourself and your dependents. This is the amount you’ll have to spend on Aetna network providers each year before the plan starts paying up to 90% of eligible medical expenses. Your total cost The maximum amount you can spend out of pocket is $1,500 for yourself or $3,000 for yourself and your dependents. Once you reach this amount, all in-network eligible medical expenses will be covered at 100%. Cost per paycheck To see your cost per paycheck for all your medical plan options, see the Compare Plans page. Keep in mind that while your share of the cost for most benefits is deducted from your paycheck before taxes are taken out, with this plan your share is paid with after-tax dollars. Who’s eligible? This plan is designed specifically for our U.S.-based Global Tech associates and is offered only to associates working in certain locations.

COBRA A way to keep your Walmart benefits. If you leave your job or are working reduced hours, you can extend your Walmart medical plan's coverage and pay the full cost yourself until you get new coverage. Your benefits safety net. Keep your coverage Continue your medical, dental, and vision coverage temporarily. Cover the cost You’ll need to pay the full cost of your coverage. Don’t wait! You have 60 days to sign up for continuationcoverage, from the date you lost coverage or the date you're notified, whichever is later. How it works COBRA lets you continue medical, dental, and vision coverage for yourself and your dependents after you lose eligibility for a Walmart medical plan, usually as the result of leaving the company or working reduced hours. The process starts when the company notifies the COBRA administrator, WageWorks (a HealthEquity company), typically within 30 days after you lose coverage. Within 14 days after they’re notified, WageWorks will send a COBRA election notice to you and any eligible dependents at your last known address. You then have 60 days to enroll from the date you lost coverage or the date of the notice, whichever is later. Your dependents can also become eligible for COBRA coverage due to your divorce, legal separation, the end of a partnership, or a child's loss of dependent status. To enroll, you or your dependent must call People Services at 800-421-1362 within 60 days after the qualifying event. Coverage lasts up to 18 months if you lose coverage, and up to 36 months if your dependents are affected by one of the events mentioned above. Your coverage may also be extended if a disability is involved. If you’re wondering, “COBRA” stands for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, the law that established this program. Enrollment and more WageWorks, our COBRA administrator, will work with you when you sign up. WageWorks will also be your point of contact for as long as you’re enrolled. Contact them at 800-570-1863, or visit mybenefits.wageworks.com. Paying for benefits Once you enroll, you or your dependents are responsible for paying 100% of the cost of coverage, plus a 2% administrative fee. Monthly payments are due on the first day of each month. WageWorks will typically send you an invoice, but you’re still responsible for making your monthly payment even if you don’t receive one. Here’s how you can make your payments: Leaving Walmart? Make sure you’re eligible for COBRA. Call People Services at 800-421-1362.

Disability Accommodations At Walmart, we understand that sometimes a medical condition can make your work difficult. We’re committed to creating an environment where all associates are safe and productive, even those with disabilities. Sometimes that means providing an accommodation - a change in policy, practices, or the environment that help an associate with a disability to perform the essential functions of their job without creating an undue hardship for the company.
It’s the Accommodation Team’s job to provide the resources you need to help do your work effectively. We also help associates find appropriate new jobs within Walmart, and assist applicants with disabilities during the hiring process. How the process works: Getting started Before you call Ask your manager about a Job Adjustment before you call for an accommodation. They may be able to offer simple changes that can make your work easier. Call the Accommodation Service Center If a Job Adjustment won’t get you back to work, call 855-489-1600 between 8 a.m.-5 p.m. CT. You’ll need your Walmart Identification Number (WIN) to get started. Questions about accommodations?
