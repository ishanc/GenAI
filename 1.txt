ASAP You can use some benefits as soon as you’re hired. Your effective date\nMost plans you enroll for\nhave an “effective date”\nbased on your date of hire when your coverage begins. Truck drivers\nTruck driver associates have different enrollment and effective dates from part-time and temporary associates. Medical coverage\nIf you’re a part-time hourly or temporary associate, including field Supply Chain associates and pharmacists but NOT part-time truck drivers, your work hours will be measured every 60 days during your first year of employment. We’ll let you know if you become eligible. For example, let’s say your hire date is May 11, 2022. Your 60th day is July 9, and on that day you’ve worked enough hours to meet the requirement. Your 89th day is Aug. 7, so benefits become effective on Aug. 1. After your first year, your hours will be measured again every year in time for Annual Enrollment in October. This will “look back” over a 52-week measurement period. Track your hours\nYou can check your hours for the current measurement period anytime with the Eligibility by Hours (EBH) Tool. You’ll need to log in to use the tool. One time only\nIf you don’t enroll when you first become eligible, you won’t have another opportunity to enroll until the next Annual Enrollment, or if you have a qualifying status event like having a baby. Non-medical benefits\nEven if you don’t meet the hours requirement for medical coverage, you’ll still become eligible for many other benefits on your 52-week anniversary date. You can enroll anytime between that date and the first day of the second calendar month following it. For example, let’s say your anniversary date is June 21, 2022. You’ll become eligible on Aug. 1, the first day of the second month after that. Tobacco\nIf you use tobacco and don’t agree to complete a program to quit, you’ll pay higher rates for medical, optional associate life insurance, spouse/partner life insurance, and critical illness insurance. For help quitting, check out our Quit Tobacco programs. When can you enroll? When do your benefits start?
